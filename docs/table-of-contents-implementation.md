2. Use React hooks (useState, useEffect, useRef) for scroll tracking
3. Implement intersection observer for detecting active sections
4. Add smooth scroll behavior with scroll-behavior CSS or JavaScript
5. Make it responsive with Tailwind CSS

## Implementation Plan
1. Create `components/TableOfContents.tsx`
2. Add heading extraction logic from HTML content
3. Implement scroll tracking and active state management
4. Style the component with proper positioning and responsive design
5. Integrate into article page layout
