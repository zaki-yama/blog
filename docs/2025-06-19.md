## What Was Accomplished Today
- Implemented header navigation with RSS feed, GitHub repository link, and dark mode toggle
- Added comprehensive dark mode support throughout the application
- Updated layout structure and styling for better user experience
- Created SocialShareButtons component for Twitter, LinkedIn, and Hatena Bookmark sharing
- Implemented structured data (JSON-LD) for SEO improvement
- Created table of contents sidebar with scroll tracking and smooth scroll
- Implemented RSS feed generation with proper XML format
- Added automatic sitemap generation for better SEO
- Comprehensive meta tags optimization with OGP and Twitter Cards
- Updated project configuration including Tailwind CSS setup

## Challenges Faced
- Initial setup required npm install before running development server
- Needed to create proper Tailwind CSS v4 configuration for dark mode support
- Had to understand the difference between TodoWrite tool usage vs direct todo.md file management per project guidelines
- Table of contents implementation required careful DOM timing to ensure heading elements are available
- RSS and sitemap generation needed proper XML formatting and namespace declarations
- Meta tags optimization required understanding Next.js metadata API structure

## Technical Learnings
- Tailwind CSS v4 has updated syntax and configuration approach
- Dark mode implementation requires both CSS classes and localStorage persistence
- Next.js App Router layout structure provides clean component organization
- Social sharing requires proper URL encoding and window.open for popup handling
- JSON-LD structured data significantly improves SEO and rich snippets potential
- Intersection Observer API is perfect for scroll tracking in table of contents
- Next.js API routes are excellent for generating XML feeds and sitemaps dynamically
- Meta tags in Next.js 15 use a comprehensive metadata API with type safety
- RSS 2.0 and XML sitemap standards require specific formatting and namespace declarations

## Emotional Reflection
- Satisfied with the clean implementation of dark mode toggle functionality
- Pleased with the responsive design and accessibility considerations in the header component

## Next Session Handoff
- All major self-contained features have been implemented successfully
- Remaining tasks require external service integration (Google Analytics, Cloudinary, OG image generation)
- Ready for deployment and testing of implemented features
- Consider implementing additional features like category pages or search functionality
- Focus should shift to external service setup and content creation workflow testing
